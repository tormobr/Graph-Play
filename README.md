# Path Finding Algorithms

## About
This repo contains a program for illustrating different path finding algorithms. This includes `breath-first search`, `depth-first search` and `A*`. Also includes the possibility of creating a maze using a randomized version of `prims minimal span tree` algorithm.

## How to run
To run the program simply execute `python game.py`
This program uses [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about), so make sure to `pip install` that first.
